# Depressive Symptoms Temporal Dynamics Analysis

This project explores the temporal dynamics of depressive symptoms using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) data. Through Power Spectrum Density (PSD) analysis and upsampling techniques, we aim to uncover the dominant frequencies of symptom fluctuations and understand their periodicity.

## Overview

Depressive symptoms exhibit temporal patterns that can provide insights into the underlying processes of depression. By analyzing EMA data, this project seeks to identify these patterns, offering a new perspective on symptom management and intervention timing.

## Key Components

- **Data Preparation**: Processing "Fisher-Data.csv" and "WARN-Data.csv" for PSD analysis, including loading, cleaning, and selecting relevant data.
- **Upsampling**: Standardizing temporal resolution across datasets to ensure comparability.
- **PSD Analysis**: Employing Welch's method to estimate the power spectrum density and identify dominant frequencies.
- **Cumulative Integral Calculation**: Quantifying the distribution of power across frequencies to highlight significant frequency bands.
- **Frequency-Time Interval Mapping**: Associating selected frequencies with descriptive time intervals for intuitive analysis.
- **Visualization**: Illustrating the distribution of cumulative PSD values to identify patterns and outliers.

## Objectives

- **Standardize Temporal Resolution**: Ensure uniform measurement frequency across datasets for consistent analysis.
- **Identify Dominant Frequencies**: Discover the primary frequencies at which depressive symptoms fluctuate.
- **Understand Temporal Dynamics**: Analyze the periodicity and cyclical patterns of depressive symptoms.

## Methodology

The project utilizes a combination of data preprocessing, Welch's method for PSD analysis, cumulative integral calculations, and innovative visualization techniques to achieve its objectives.

## Insights and Findings

- **Temporal Patterns**: Identified specific frequencies that correspond to regular symptom fluctuations.
- **Cyclical Symptom Dynamics**: Uncovered potential cyclical patterns in depressive symptoms, suggesting new avenues for timing interventions.
- **Data Visualization**: Provided a clear representation of the PSD analysis findings, facilitating intuitive understanding of symptom dynamics.

## Visualization Highlights

The project includes detailed visualizations of the cumulative PSD data, showcasing the distribution and central tendencies across different time intervals. These visualizations are instrumental in conveying the analysis findings.

## Conclusion

This analysis offers valuable insights into the temporal dynamics of depressive symptoms, contributing to a deeper understanding of depression's underlying processes. The findings underscore the importance of considering temporal patterns in symptom management and intervention planning.
